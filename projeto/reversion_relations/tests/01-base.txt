BASE

This application has the mission to use django-reversion functions to make a
ForeignKey-like field to make foreign relationships to objects withouth lost
their informations as they were when the relation has made.

The functions of this application are basically the following ones:

- A new model field
- Its respective form field
- Its respective form widget

This is the common way to make a foreign relation:

    ----------------------------------                    -------------------
    |            Purchase            |------------------->|     Supplier    |
    ---------------------------------- 0..*          0..1 -------------------
    | supplier: ForeignKey(Supplier) |                    | primary_key     |
    | other fields...                |                    | other fields... |
    ----------------------------------                    -------------------

Thinking on some instances:

    - You are the store
    - Nike is a supplier
    - The first purchase you made from Nike was in 2010-03-10
    - So, at 2010-04-30 Nike changed their location
    - And now you made a new purshase
    - So, you have a problem: they are asking for a bigger payment for billing
    - But you know they were so much nearer to you than they were when you made the previous purchase
    - So, you are going to confirm their location some months ago
    - And you notice you haven't their location because it has changed
    - So, you have a problem

The problem: if supplier changed its location, sometime in the future nobody
will know where pur

The workflow of this application should be as following:

    ------------                                            ------------
    | Purchase |                                            | Supplier |
    ------------                                            ------------
          | 0..*                                                1 ^
          |                                                       |
          |             0..1 ------------------- 0..*             |
          ------------------>|     Version     |-------------------
              ForeignKey     -------------------  generic relation
                             | serialized JSON |
                             -------------------

Version is a class from django-reversion (reversion.models.Version).

The serialization is well-made by django-reversion but the ForeignKey you have to make
by yourself.

But the solution above is not enough, because:

    - The builtin ForeignKey model field will not return the Supplier's informations
      so easy as it works for direct relation
    - The default work of ForeignKey on forms (as form field as form widget) will also
      not work as we'd like.

So we need for:

    - A new extended ForeignKey model field: ReversionForeignKey
    - A new form field: ReversionChoiceField
    - A new widget: ReversionChoiceWidget

Application in PYTHONPATH (as pluggable as possible)
----------------------------------------------------

    >>> import reversion_relations

ReversionForeignKey
-------------------

    >>> from reversion_relations.fields import ReversionForeignKey

    >>> from reversion_relations.tests.test_models import Supplier, Purchase, create_tables
    >>> create_tables()

    >>> import datetime

    >>> nike = Supplier.objects.create(name='Nike', location='Av. Paulista, Centro, Sao Paulo - SP')

The first purchase was joined to supplier when it had a location...

    >>> purchase1 = Purchase.objects.create(supplier=nike, date=datetime.date(2010, 3, 10))

    >>> nike.location = 'Av. Brasil, Centro, Rio de Janeiro - RJ'
    >>> nike.save()

And the second purchase was joined after supplier changed its location

    >>> purchase2 = Purchase.objects.create(supplier=nike, date=datetime.date(2010, 4, 30))

Setting supplier on a new object, before save...

    >>> purchase3 = Purchase()
    >>> purchase3.supplier = nike
    >>> purchase3.date = datetime.date(2010, 5, 9)

It is just the related object

    >>> purchase3.supplier
    <Supplier: Nike>

    >>> purchase3.save()

Checking after saved

    >>> purchase3.supplier
    <Supplier: Nike>

Getting objects again...

    >>> nike = Supplier.objects.get(pk=nike.pk)
    >>> purchase1 = Purchase.objects.get(pk=purchase1.pk)
    >>> purchase2 = Purchase.objects.get(pk=purchase2.pk)

    >>> nike.location
    u'Av. Brasil, Centro, Rio de Janeiro - RJ'

    >>> purchase1.supplier
    <Supplier: Nike>

    >>> purchase1.supplier.location
    u'Av. Paulista, Centro, Sao Paulo - SP'

    >>> purchase2.supplier
    <Supplier: Nike>

    >>> purchase2.supplier.location
    u'Av. Brasil, Centro, Rio de Janeiro - RJ'

ReversionChoiceField
--------------------

    >>> from reversion_relations.fields import ReversionChoiceField

    >>> from reversion_relations.fields import ReversionChoiceWidget
