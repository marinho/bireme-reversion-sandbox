This application has the mission to use django-reversion functions to make a
ForeignKey-like field to make foreign relationships to objects withouth lost
their informations as they were when the relation has made.

The functions of this application are basically the following ones:

- A new model field
- Its respective form field
- Its respective form widget

This is the common way to make a foreign relation:

    ----------------------------------                    -------------------
    |            Purchase            |------------------->|     Supplier    |
    ---------------------------------- 0..*          0..1 -------------------
    | supplier: ForeignKey(Supplier) |                    | primary_key     |
    | other fields...                |                    | other fields... |
    ----------------------------------                    -------------------

Thinking on some instances:

    - You are the store
    - Nike is a supplier
    - Grendene is another supplier
    - The first purchase you made from Nike was in 2010-03-10
    - So, at 2010-04-30 Nike changed their location
    - And now you made a new purshase
    - So, you have a problem: they are asking for a bigger payment for billing
    - But you know they were so much nearer to you than they were when you made the previous purchase
    - So, you are going to confirm their location some months ago
    - And you notice you haven't their location because it has changed
    - So, you have a problem

The problem: if supplier changed its location, sometime in the future nobody
will know where pur
