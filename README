This project exists with following goals:

- Demonstrate how to implement django-reversion [1]
- Implement django-reversion together with django-polyglot [2]
- Implement a pluggable application that uses django-reversion to make a ForeignKey that keeps current version as related object [3]

### Using reversion manually

    # models.py
    from reversion.revisions import revision
    if not revision.is_registered(MyModelClass): revision.register(MyModelClass)

    # Anywhere at the code
    from reversion.revisions import revision
    revision.start()
    obj.save()
    ...
    # anyone and many as necessary can be saved
    ...
    revision.end()
